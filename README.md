# Observer Design Pattern - Demo

In this repo you can find implementation of observer design pattern using simple scenario.

## Scenario

Digital devices such as smartphones, laptops, wireless speakers etc. powered by a battery. Therefore, there are functions for display battery level to the user, show notification when battery is low and switch to power saver mode when necessary. These functions should triggered when battery level is changing. Your task is to implement a system to notify user about the changing of the battery level.

__Task 1:__ Display the battery level when it is changing.

__Task 2:__ Display a notification to user when battery level <= 20%

__Task 3:__ Turn on power saving mode automatically when battery level is below 18%

__Hint:__ You can use observer design pattern to observe the change of the battery level.
